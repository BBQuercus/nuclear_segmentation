# Nuclear Segmentation

My Master thesis was conducted in the Chao lab at the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research (Basel, Switzerland). A large part of my project involved confocal microscopy of cellular samples. After realizing that traditional, thresholding based approaches are only able to segment so much, I decided to develop a machine learning based method. The results are shown here.
