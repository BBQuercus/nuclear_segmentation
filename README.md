# Nuclear Segmentation

My master thesis is in the Chao lab at the Friedrich Miescher Institute for Biomedical Research (Basel, Switzerland). Part of my project involved confocal microscopy of cellular samples. After realizing that traditional, thresholding based approaches are only able to segment so much, I decided to develop a machine learning based method.
